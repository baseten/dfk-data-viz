# DeFiKingdoms Data Viz Side Quest Contest

An Interactive SVG built with React and D3, showing the historical growth of circulating 
xJewel compared with circulating Jewel, overlaid with the price feed.

xJewel/Jewel data is taken from Samichpunch's awesome Whale Watch series.

## Limitations/Improvements
Because hey I have a full time job and life happens:
* I had hoped to find a much more granular data source for circulating xJewel and bank inflows/outflows, this would give a better indication as to when bank deposits and withdrawals are correlated with Jewel price action
* It would be great to include a third stream in the graph for Jewel deposited in LP positions
* I'd also intended to provide multiple data sources beyond just the price feed to use in the graph overlay and make these selectable by the user (eg. daily bank deposit/withdrawals, number of xJewel wallets, number of active DFK players, etc.)
* I'd planned (and still intend to produce) a generative NFT using DFK graphics based on this same data
